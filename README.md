# üß† AI Image to Video Generator

A full-stack MERN project that allows users to upload an image (via file or URL), optionally give creative instructions, and uses **Google's Image-to-Video AI model (VEO-2)** to generate a video clip. Users can view the result directly on the UI.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Upload image via file **or** provide an image URL
- Enter additional instruction or prompt for the AI model
- Sleek and beautiful UI
- Built using **React (Vite)** + **DaisyUI**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Cloudinary**

---

## ü§ñ AI Model Used

Used **Google VEO-2 (Image-to-Video)** model via API.

### Why VEO-2?

- Produces **high-quality, cinematic video clips** from a single image
- Supports additional **text prompt guidance** for creative control

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How the Pipeline Works

1. **Frontend (React)**
   - User selects image (from disk or pastes a URL)
   - Adds optional instructions
   - Data is sent to server for generating a generation id for accessing the UI.

2. **Backend (Express + Cloudinary)**
   - Accepts form-data using multer js.
   - File will be uploaded  to Cloudinary
   - If URL was provided ‚Üí forward
   - Send the image URL + prompt to the Google VEO-2 API
   - Receive a `generation_id` from the model
   - Store a new history of the uploading done
   - Return `generation_id`  it to frontend

3. **Frontend (Polling)**
   - Starts polling `/api/upload_status?generation_id=...`
   - Update the history with the new uploaded url
   - Once the video is ready, shows the result

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations / Assumptions

- Free-tier Cloudinary used for storing videos (limited bandwidth/storage)
- Polling interval is hardcoded (3s) instead of WebSockets
- Assumes image is always valid ‚Äî no advanced file type/size validation
